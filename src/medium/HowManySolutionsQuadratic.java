//How Many Solutions Does This Quadratic Have?
//
//A quadratic equation a x + b x + c = 0 has either 0, 1, or 2 
//distinct solutions for real values of x. Given a, b and c, 
//you should return the number of solutions to the equation.
//
//Examples
//solutions(1, 0, -1) -> 2
//// x - 1 = 0 has two solutions (x = 1 and x = -1).
//solutions(1, 0, 0) -> 1
//// x = 0 has one solution (x = 0).
//solutions(1, 0, 1) -> 0
//// x + 1 = 0 has no real solutions.
